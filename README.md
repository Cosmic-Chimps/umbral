# Umbral

A self-hosted OpenID Connect provider whose only job is **social login**.
Your apps talk to Umbral using any standard OIDC library. Umbral talks to
Discord, GitHub and Google. You wire each provider up once, in one place,
instead of in every app.

It ships as **one container with an embedded SQLite database**: no Postgres, no
Redis, no sidecar. It is meant for a homelab or a small project: a Raspberry Pi
(64-bit OS) is enough.

It has three concepts, and that is the whole product:

| Concept | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| **App** | A program that signs people in through Umbral. It gets a client ID and a client secret. |
| **Connector** | A social provider Umbral signs people in with: Discord, GitHub or Google. |
| **User** | A person who has signed in at least once. |

**What Umbral is not.** It has no realms, tenants, groups, roles or permissions,
no SAML or LDAP, no MFA, no local password accounts and no login-flow builder,
and it will not get them. It answers "who is this person?"; what they may do is
the app's job. If you need any of those, use
[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) or [Authentik](https://goauthentik.io/),
which are good at it.

## Requirements

- **Docker.** Nothing else is needed to run Umbral.
- **A 64-bit machine**: `linux/amd64` or `linux/arm64` (a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5
  with a 64-bit OS works). Umbral is designed to idle under 150 MB of memory.
- **For a real deployment: a domain name and HTTPS.** Umbral refuses an
  `http://` address for anything but `localhost`, so a bare LAN IP such as
  `http://192.168.1.50:8080` does not work. See
  [Run it for real](#run-it-for-real-behind-https). To try Umbral first, the
  quick start below needs neither.
- **An account with at least one provider** (GitHub is the least friction) to
  create an OAuth app in. Umbral cannot do that for you.

No image is published to a registry yet, so you build it from this repository.

## Quick start: a first login on your own machine

This gets one real login working on a laptop in a few minutes. It uses plain
`http://localhost`, which Umbral allows only when you ask for it explicitly.
**It is for a laptop only. Do not expose this setup to a network.** The
production setup is [further down](#run-it-for-real-behind-https).

### 1. Build the image

```bash
git clone <URL of this repository> umbral
cd umbral
docker build -t umbral .
```

The first build downloads the .NET SDK and compiles Umbral, which takes a few
minutes. On a Raspberry Pi it is slower; if you would rather build on a faster
machine and copy the image over:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t umbral --load .
docker save umbral | ssh pi@raspberrypi docker load
```

### 2. Run it

```bash
docker run -d --name umbral \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 \
  -v umbral-data:/data \
  -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development \
  -e UMBRAL__INSECURE_ALLOW_HTTP=true \
  -e UMBRAL__PUBLIC_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8080 \
  umbral
```

- `-v umbral-data:/data` keeps everything Umbral stores in a Docker volume.
  [Back it up](#your-data-back-it-up).
- `UMBRAL__PUBLIC_ORIGIN` is the address people type in the browser. Umbral
  refuses to start without it.
- The last two `-e` lines are the "plain http on localhost" switch. Both are
  required; either one alone is ignored.
- `127.0.0.1:` in `-p` keeps the port off your network.

### 3. Claim the instance

There is no default password. Read the one-time setup token from the log:

```bash
docker logs umbral
```

Near the end you will see:

```
================================================================
  Umbral is not configured yet.

  Open     http://localhost:8080/admin/setup
  Token    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  ...
```

Open that address, paste the token, and choose an **operator credential** of at
least 12 characters. It is the only way into the admin area and it is not tied
to any provider, so a broken Discord or Google app can never lock you out. Use
a password manager: there is no recovery screen (but see
[Forgotten operator credential](#forgotten-operator-credential)).

> Umbral has no front page: `/` and `/admin` answer "Not found". The admin area
> starts at `/admin/setup` the first time and `/admin/signin` afterwards.

You land on the **Connectors** screen. The admin area has three screens:
**Apps**, **Connectors**, **Users**.

### 4. Add a connector (GitHub)

1. On the **GitHub** card, find **Redirect URI to register with the provider**
   and copy it. It is `<origin>/connect/github/callback`, here
   `http://localhost:8080/connect/github/callback`. Umbral builds it for you:
   do not type it by hand.
2. In GitHub: your profile picture → **Settings** → **Developer settings**
   (bottom of the left menu) → **OAuth Apps** → **New OAuth App**
   (`https://github.com/settings/applications/new`).
3. Fill in:
   - **Application name**: anything, for example `Umbral`. People see it when
     GitHub asks them to authorize.
   - **Homepage URL**: anything, for example `http://localhost:8080`.
   - **Authorization callback URL**: the URL you copied in step 1.
   - Leave **Enable Device Flow** unchecked.
4. Click **Register application**, copy the **Client ID**, then click
   **Generate a new client secret** and copy it right away. GitHub shows it only
   once.
5. Back in Umbral, paste both into the GitHub card and click
   **Save connector**. It is enabled immediately. No restart is needed, now or
   whenever you change a connector later.

(Menu names are as of writing; GitHub moves things around occasionally. More
detail and the gotchas are in the [GitHub walkthrough](docs/connectors/github.md).)

### 5. Register an app

Open **Apps** and fill in:

- **Name**: anything.
- **Redirect URI**: where your app receives the login result. For this test use
  `http://localhost:3000/callback`. It is matched **exactly**; wildcards are
  refused.
- **App type**: **Web application** (the app has a server that can keep a
  secret). Pick **Single-page app or native app** only for an app that cannot.
  It gets no secret and relies on PKCE alone.

Click **Create app**. A card appears with the **client ID** and **client
secret**. **Copy the secret now.** Umbral stores only a hash of it and shows it
this once. If you lose it, use **Regenerate secret**.

### 6. Prove it works, with no app of your own

Open this address in your browser (replace `CLIENT_ID`):

```
http://localhost:8080/connect/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/callback&scope=openid%20email%20profile&code_challenge=E9Melhoa2OwvFrEMTJguCHaoeK1t8URWbuGJSstw-cM&code_challenge_method=S256&state=test
```

You get Umbral's **Sign in** page with a **Sign in with GitHub** button. Click it,
approve in GitHub, and the browser ends up on
`http://localhost:3000/callback?code=…&state=test&iss=…`. The page itself will
fail to load because nothing listens on port 3000, and that is fine: **a
`code=` in the address bar is the proof.** You are also now listed on the
**Users** screen.

(`code_challenge` above is the fixed example from RFC 7636, so the next command
can use its matching verifier. Use it for this test only, never in a real app.)

To trade the code for tokens, run this straight away (a code is short-lived
and works once):

```bash
curl -s -u CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET \
  -d grant_type=authorization_code \
  -d code=PASTE_THE_CODE \
  -d redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/callback \
  -d code_verifier=dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk \
  http://localhost:8080/connect/token
```

The JSON has an `access_token` and an `id_token`. The `id_token` payload (a
standard JWT) carries `sub`, `email`, `email_verified`, `name` and `idp`.

## Integrate an app

An app needs exactly **three values**, all on the **Apps** screen:

| Value | Where it comes from |
| --- | --- |
| **Issuer** | Your `UMBRAL__PUBLIC_ORIGIN`, for example `https://auth.example.com` (the **Issuer URL** field on the app's card) |
| **Client ID** | The app's card |
| **Client secret** | Shown once, when you create the app |

Any OpenID Connect client library will configure itself from the discovery
document, so there is nothing Umbral-specific to install:

```
https://auth.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

And register one thing in Umbral: the app's **redirect URI**. Which one that is
depends on the library. ASP.NET Core's OpenID Connect handler uses
`https://app.example.com/signin-oidc` by default; most libraries document theirs.

A minimal ASP.NET Core example (`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect`,
the stock handler):

```csharp
builder.Services
    .AddAuthentication(o =>
    {
        o.DefaultScheme = "Cookies";
        o.DefaultChallengeScheme = "Umbral";
    })
    .AddCookie("Cookies")
    .AddOpenIdConnect("Umbral", o =>
    {
        o.Authority = "https://auth.example.com";   // issuer
        o.ClientId = "…";
        o.ClientSecret = "…";
        o.ResponseType = "code";                    // the only flow Umbral offers
        o.UsePkce = true;                           // required
        o.Scope.Add("email");
        o.Scope.Add("profile");
    });
```

What an app can count on:

- **Authorization code flow with PKCE (`S256`) is the only flow.** PKCE is
  required even for apps with a secret, and `plain` is refused. No implicit or
  password grant.
- **Scopes:** `openid`, `email`, `profile`, and `offline_access` if you want a
  refresh token.
- **Redirect URIs are matched exactly.** A request whose `redirect_uri` is not
  the registered string is answered with an Umbral error page, not a redirect.
- **The token endpoint** (`/connect/token`) accepts the secret as HTTP Basic or
  as a form field (`client_secret_basic` or `client_secret_post`).
- **`sub`** is stable for a user and opaque: it is not derived from any
  provider's ID. If you delete a user and they sign in again, they get a
  *different* `sub`.
- **`email` and `email_verified` may be missing.** A GitHub user can keep their
  email private, and a Discord account can be unverified. Handle both.
- **`name`, `preferred_username`, `picture`** come with the `profile` scope when
  the provider supplied them. **`idp`** is Umbral's one extra claim: the
  connector the person used (`github`, `discord`, `google`). Ignore it freely.
- **Access tokens are opaque.** They are not JWTs: do not try to decode them.
  Validate them by calling `/connect/userinfo`. Disabling a user cuts their
  tokens off immediately.
- **The `issuer` in the discovery document ends with a slash**
  (`https://auth.example.com/`), and so does `iss` in the `id_token`. Libraries
  that read the discovery document do the right thing. If you hard-code the
  issuer and your library compares strings, copy it from the discovery document.

Limits of the Apps screen today: an app has **one redirect URI** (plus an
optional post-logout one), chosen when you create it, and the app's client ID is
generated. To change a redirect URI, delete the app and register it again. You
get a new client ID and secret.

### How people are identified

Signing in with the same provider account always gives the same Umbral user. If
someone then signs in through a **second provider** and both providers assert
the **same, verified email address**, Umbral links the two to one user. An email
a provider has not verified is never used to link anyone. If no email is
available, a new user is created. You can disable or delete users on the
**Users** screen.

## Run it for real, behind HTTPS

Umbral serves plain HTTP on port 8080 inside the container and expects a reverse
proxy in front of it to terminate TLS. **The repository's
[`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) does this with Caddy**, which also
fetches and renews the certificate for you.

Before you start:

1. Pick a **domain name** and point its DNS at the machine. A free dynamic-DNS
   name works.
2. Make ports **80 and 443** reach that machine. Caddy needs them to obtain the
   certificate. Until DNS and ports are right, the browser shows a TLS error,
   not an Umbral error.

Then, in the checkout:

```bash
UMBRAL_DOMAIN=auth.example.com docker compose up -d
docker compose logs umbral
```

(or put `UMBRAL_DOMAIN=auth.example.com` in a `.env` file next to the compose
file). `docker compose logs umbral` shows the setup URL and token, exactly as in
the quick start. Continue from step 3 with the **https** address.

Umbral itself is never published on a port, so everything reaches it through
Caddy. **Do not publish port 8080 on a public host.**

> Compose names the container after the folder you cloned into, so
> `docker exec umbral …` and `docker logs umbral` may not find it. Use
> `docker compose logs umbral`, `docker compose exec umbral …` and so on.

### The public origin must match exactly

`UMBRAL__PUBLIC_ORIGIN` is the one setting Umbral cannot start without, and it
must be **exactly the address people use**: scheme, host and port, with no path.
Umbral builds the issuer and every provider callback URL from it. It never
guesses from the incoming request, because behind a proxy the request says
something else (`http://umbral:8080`).

That value must byte-match what you registered in the provider's console. When
it does not, the provider answers **`redirect_uri_mismatch`** (or Google's
"Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch"), and the login fails. The compose file builds
the origin from `UMBRAL_DOMAIN` so the origin and Caddy's address cannot drift.
If you change the origin, the callback URL changes, so register the new one with
every provider. The Connectors screen shows a warning banner whenever you reach
it at an address that differs from the configured origin.

Umbral cannot run under a sub-path (`https://example.com/auth`): the origin must
be a bare host.

### Using a different reverse proxy

nginx, Traefik and others work, if the proxy:

- terminates TLS and talks to `umbral:8080` over plain HTTP;
- sends **`X-Forwarded-Proto`** (and `X-Forwarded-For`). Without
  `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`, Umbral sees plain http and answers
  `This server only accepts HTTPS requests.`;
- passes the original **`Host`** (or sets `X-Forwarded-Host`). The endpoint URLs in
  the discovery document follow it.

Caddy's `reverse_proxy` does all three by default. nginx needs
`proxy_set_header Host $host;` and `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;`
written out.

## Your data: back it up

> **Everything Umbral keeps is in one directory, `/data`. If you lose it, you
> lose every connector secret and every app secret, and every issued token stops
> working.** You would re-enter each provider's client secret, regenerate each
> app's secret and update every app. Back it up, and test that you can restore
> it.

What is in there:

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `umbral.db` | SQLite database: connectors, users, apps, the security log. (While running you will also see `umbral.db-wal` and `umbral.db-shm`: they belong with it.) |
| `keys/` | Token signing and encryption keys, and the key ring that encrypts the stored secrets |
| `umbral.yaml` | Your [configuration file](#configuration-as-code), if you use one |

**Back up** = copy the directory. **Stop Umbral first**: SQLite keeps recent
writes in the `-wal` file, and a copy taken mid-write can be inconsistent. A
clean stop folds everything into `umbral.db`.

With the quick-start `docker run` container:

```bash
docker stop umbral
mkdir -p backup
docker run --rm --user root --entrypoint cp \
  -v umbral-data:/data:ro -v "$PWD/backup":/backup umbral -a /data/. /backup/
docker start umbral
```

With compose (run in the checkout):

```bash
docker compose stop umbral
mkdir -p backup
docker compose run --rm --no-deps --user root --entrypoint cp \
  -v "$PWD/backup":/backup umbral -a /data/. /backup/
docker compose start umbral
```

**Restore** is the same copy in the other direction. Umbral runs as a non-root
user (UID 1654), so the files must be owned by it:

```bash
docker stop umbral        # compose: docker compose stop umbral
docker run --rm --user root --entrypoint sh \
  -v umbral-data:/data -v "$PWD/backup":/backup:ro umbral \
  -c 'rm -rf /data/* && cp -a /backup/. /data/ && chown -R 1654:1654 /data'
docker start umbral
```

With compose:

```bash
docker compose stop umbral
docker compose run --rm --no-deps --user root --entrypoint sh \
  -v "$PWD/backup":/backup:ro umbral \
  -c 'rm -rf /data/* && cp -a /backup/. /data/ && chown -R 1654:1654 /data'
docker compose start umbral
```

If you use a bind mount (`-v ./data:/data`) instead of a named volume, copy the
host directory with `cp -a` and make it writable for UID 1654 first:
`chown -R 1654:1654 ./data`.

On Linux the copied files are owned by root; use `sudo` to move or read them.

**Treat the backup like a password database.** The keys that decrypt the stored
secrets are in the same directory, so anyone who holds a copy of `/data` holds
every secret in it.

## Configuration as code

Everything you can click you can also write in one YAML file. Umbral reads it
**at startup**, from `/data/umbral.yaml` or from the path in
`UMBRAL__CONFIG_FILE`:

```yaml
version: 1

connectors:
  - slug: github                       # fixed: it is in the callback URL
    kind: github                       # discord | github | google
    display_name: GitHub
    client_id: "Ov23liXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    client_secret: ${UMBRAL_GITHUB_SECRET}
    enabled: true
    # extra_scopes: []                 # optional, added to the scopes Umbral requests
```

- **Secrets are never written in the file.** `client_secret` must be a
  `${VARIABLE}` reference that Umbral resolves from its environment. A literal
  value is an *error*, on purpose: the file is meant to live in version control.
  Set the variable on the container, for example in compose:

  ```yaml
  services:
    umbral:
      environment:
        UMBRAL_GITHUB_SECRET: ${UMBRAL_GITHUB_SECRET}   # from your .env file
        UMBRAL__CONFIG_FILE: /config/umbral.yaml
      volumes:
        - ./umbral.yaml:/config/umbral.yaml:ro
  ```

- **Applying is idempotent.** `slug` identifies a connector, so applying the same
  file twice changes nothing and creates no duplicates.
- **The file wins on every start.** A connector in the file is re-applied each
  time Umbral starts, overwriting what you changed in the admin UI for that
  slug (client ID, secret, enabled). Connectors that are not in the file are left
  alone.
- **A bad file stops Umbral from starting**, naming the entry and what to do
  (`docker logs umbral`). Nothing is partly applied.
- **Export what you have clicked.** Signed in as the operator, open
  `https://auth.example.com/admin/config` in your browser. It downloads
  `umbral.yaml` in exactly this format, with `${UMBRAL_<SLUG>_SECRET}`
  placeholders in place of secrets. There is no button for it in the admin UI
  yet; it is only that address.
- **App secrets cannot be exported**, because Umbral stores only a hash of them.
  An export lists your apps without secrets.
- **Apps in the file:** this build checks the `apps:` section for mistakes at
  startup, but it only *applies* `connectors:`. Register apps in the admin UI.

## Forgotten operator credential

Run this on the machine that hosts the container:

```bash
docker exec -it umbral /app/Umbral reset-credential
# compose:
docker compose exec umbral /app/Umbral reset-credential
```

It replaces the credential with a freshly generated one and prints it, once.
Sign in at `/admin/signin` with it and store it in a password manager. There is
deliberately no "forgot your credential" page: reaching this command needs
access to the machine, which is more than reaching the web page needs.

## Settings reference

Set these as environment variables on the container.

| Variable | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UMBRAL__PUBLIC_ORIGIN` | *required* | The address people reach Umbral at, e.g. `https://auth.example.com`. Scheme, host, optional port; no path. `http` is accepted only for `localhost`. |
| `UMBRAL__DATA_DIRECTORY` | `/data` (set in the image) | Where Umbral keeps everything. Must be writable. |
| `UMBRAL__CONFIG_FILE` | `<data directory>/umbral.yaml` | The [configuration file](#configuration-as-code). Optional. |
| `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` + `UMBRAL__INSECURE_ALLOW_HTTP` | unset | `Development` **and** `true` together allow plain `http://localhost`. Laptop trial only. Never set them on a server. |

## Troubleshooting

Commands below use the quick-start container name. With compose, write
`docker compose logs umbral` for `docker logs umbral`.

**The container exits right after starting.**
`docker logs umbral`: Umbral names the setting. Usual causes:
`UMBRAL__PUBLIC_ORIGIN` is missing, has a path (`https://auth.example.com/auth`)
or is `http://` with a host other than `localhost`; or `/data` is not writable. For a bind mount, run
`chown -R 1654:1654 ./data`. A broken `umbral.yaml` also stops startup and names
the line.

**`/` or `/admin` shows "Not found".**
That is expected: Umbral has no front page and no `/admin` page. Use
`/admin/setup` (first time) or `/admin/signin`.

**I cannot find the setup token, or it is rejected.**
`docker logs umbral` and take the *latest* `Token` line. The token is regenerated
each time the container starts, and only matters until you set the credential.
If the credential is already set, use `/admin/signin`, or
[reset it](#forgotten-operator-credential).

**The provider says `redirect_uri_mismatch` (or "redirect URI is not valid").**
The URL registered in the provider's console is not byte-identical to the one
Umbral sends. Copy it again from the connector card
(`<origin>/connect/<slug>/callback`), check `http` vs `https`, the port, a
trailing slash and upper/lower case, and check that `UMBRAL__PUBLIC_ORIGIN` is
the address you actually use. If the Connectors screen shows an origin-mismatch
banner, fix the origin or the proxy first. Google can take a few minutes to
honour a new redirect URI.

**`This server only accepts HTTPS requests.`**
Umbral saw plain http. Either the proxy is not sending
`X-Forwarded-Proto: https` (see
[Using a different reverse proxy](#using-a-different-reverse-proxy)), or you are
talking to port 8080 directly. The laptop trial is the only place plain http is
allowed.

**My app shows "That sign-in request was rejected".**
Umbral's own error page, with a reason. The usual two: the app's `redirect_uri`
is not exactly the one registered for it (compare character by character, as it
appears in the app's authorization request), or the app is not using PKCE with
`S256`. Libraries usually have a "use PKCE" switch.

**Someone clicks a provider and sees "Sign-in didn't complete".**
They see "Sign-in didn't complete" and nothing technical; the cause is in the security log.
Typical causes: a wrong or rotated client secret (open **Connectors**, use
**Replace client secret**), or a provider app that is not allowed to log that
person in (Google "Testing" mode: see the [Google walkthrough](docs/connectors/google.md)).
To read the log, query the database from the host (needs the `sqlite3` tool):

```bash
sqlite3 -readonly /path/to/umbral.db \
  "select occurred_utc, event_type, outcome, connector_slug, detail
     from security_events order by id desc limit 20;"
```

With a named Docker volume on Linux the path is usually
`/var/lib/docker/volumes/umbral-data/_data/umbral.db` (needs `sudo`); on Docker
Desktop, [copy the directory out](#your-data-back-it-up) and open the copy.

**After a restore or a lost volume, connectors or apps stop working.**
If `/data/keys` did not come back, stored secrets cannot be decrypted and tokens
no longer validate. In **Connectors** use **Replace client secret** for each
provider, and **Regenerate secret** for each app, then update the apps.
